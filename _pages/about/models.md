pandapower combines the data analysis library pandas and the power flow solver PYPOWER to create an easy to use network calculation program aimed at automation of analysis and optimization in power systems.

pandapower is an element based network calculation tool that supports the following components:

	- lines
	- two-winding and three-winding transformers
	- ideal bus-bus and bus-branch switches
	- static generators
	- ZIP loads
	- shunts
	- external grid connections
	- synchronous generators
	- DC lines
	- unsymmetric impedances
	- ward equivalents
	
pandapower supports the following network analysis functions:

	- power flow
	- optimal power flow
	- state estimation
	- short-circuit calculation according to IEC 60909
	- topological graph searches
